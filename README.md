# AtmelUC3C-Framework
During multiple projects using the AT32UC3C 32bit microcontroller series I created this set of functions. They are a good alternative when you not want to use the Atmel/Microchip ASF framework or use other toolchains.

The IO and PWM driver are originally based on functions from "Zippy" out of the www.mikrocontroller.net forum. Unfortunately I do not have original links, but I noted this in the corresponding files and preserved the original headers.
